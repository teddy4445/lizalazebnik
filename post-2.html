			During the coronavirus pandemic, many unusual services and ways of doing usual things without leaving home appeared around the world. So, many theaters, circuses, and other creative public associations, such as the Bolshoi Theater and Mariinsky Theater joined the Internet space. Of course, they have a good purpose to help us easier and more interesting to spend a quarantine at home. We are very grateful to all the artists and other specialists involved in the preparation of the performances and broadcasts. Watching concerts at home on the screens is becoming a kind of alternative to movies and TV shows, but can modern technology recreate that special atmosphere of the theater? Can the most professional video shooting immerse the viewer in an incredible condition of unity of the viewer, actor, and author? Let's see if this format of video performances has a future after the coronavirus.
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			So what is the fundamental difference between cinema and theater?
			</h3>
			
			<p>
			As a starting point, we need to define the terminology: “Theater is a form of art that is represented as an artistic image of reality through the stage play of artists in front of the audience.”, And “Cinema is a form of art based on the fusion of acting and the audiovisual technical component.” The first differences are already clear from the definitions, but let's see how theater and cinema differ for the viewer.
			</p>
			
			<table class="table">
				<thead>
					<tr>
					  <th scope="col">Theater</th>
					  <th scope="col">Cinema</th>
					</tr>
				  </thead>
			  <tbody>
				<tr>
				  <td>The performance is on the space of one stage. The theater cannot realistically recreate the atmosphere of the street, nature, etc., outside the scope of the stage and scenery.</td>
				  <td> The cinema has great technical capabilities for creating special effects and changing locations for shooting a film. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>Performance going on for the audience in the hall, where the actor and the audience can have a communicative contact.</td>
				  <td>The audience of the film is numerous and diverse. Actors do not have direct contact with the audience during the game.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td> The inability to express certain emotions with facial expressions and other poorly visible gestures for a large hall, so the actors engage in hyperbolization of other expressive means. </td>
				  <td>In the movie you can see facial expressions and individual gestures in large frames. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td> All scenes of the performance going on in direct sequence, which allows actors to organically keep the atmosphere of the play. </td>
				  <td>Each scene is shooting separately. Actors cannot always keep a character, because separate fragments of the film in the general stream may be inorganic.  </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>The viewer can simultaneously and holistically perceive all the actors on the stage. </td>
				  <td>The film does not have the ability to change, therefore, each time watching the same.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>The same theatrical production cannot be repeated twice because of the creative process, improvisation, and replacement of actors.</td>
				  <td>In the movie, the viewer sees exactly those frames that entered the video sequence according to the director and due to the technical framework in the process of shooting the film.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>The actors have no way to fix or replay the failed scene.</td>
				  <td>Actors can remove several takes due to a mistake or to improve the quality of the acting.</td>
				</tr>
			  </tbody>
			</table>
			
			<table class="table">
			  <tbody>
				<tr>
				  <td>Also, the broadcast of the performance can be compared with the perception of the picture outside the gallery or museum. The artist purposefully works on each painting in a specific format, selects a palette, and uses special techniques to create textures. The viewer should look at the picture in the form that the artist intended it because the capabilities of the computer or the printed picture do not convey the impressions that the original picture brings because of its format, which is usually larger than the copy, color, and texture. On a copy or reproduction, we can only see the actual plot of the picture: the location of the characters or objects, some details, but nothing more important. While in real viewing, we can perceive the texture, the original color palette. We can be in the artist's intended distance from the painting in full size. That is why the perception of the picture in the gallery or museum will be completely different from the digital version or reproduction. The same principle applies when we watch a play. For the same reasons, art critics strongly recommend getting to know art directly in places specially created for each particular art form: theaters, art galleries, and museums. </td>

			  </tbody>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			Based on the revealed facts, we can understand that video broadcasting of a play during a pandemic and quarantine is a very useful idea that will help many people contact with the theater or visit plays that the viewer could not visit directly in the theater for various reasons. In any case, we advise, after overcoming the Covid-19, not to stop being interested in theatrical art and to visit a real theater.
