			<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
				Today, as never before, the high-tech community is the most active and international relative to any other community in the world. Russian-speaking specialists are numerously involved in the Israeli high-tech industry and often noticeably different from their native Israeli сolleagues (namely, “chabers”) in their perception of being effective. What are the main differences between the working style of native Israeli and Russian-speaking experts? Note that all observations in this post are based upon personal experience of a handful of professionals of both groups and shall not be considered a sociological proven theorem.

			</div>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			As already mentioned, the following observations are the product of several years of experience  working with  specialists from both communities of several native Israeli and Russian-speaking, professionals. We argue that the following points are interesting for all involved in the technology world as they summarize the assets of multiple points of view while preserving a high level of an agreement between them; resulting in cross-industry insights.
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			Coworkers voluntary vs. obligated review 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Russian-speaking specialists discuss their work on the project more with colleagues within the team and often turn to their boss for recommendations  In most cases, Russian employees seek to verify the correctness and quality of the task at each stage of the project and they are not afraid to sort out their mistakes among their colleagues. This approach has a positive effect on the quality of the overall product and helps to unite the team to achieve any goals. Israeli specialists are more likely to rely on their knowledge and experience and prefer not to ``distract’’ colleagues from their duties.

			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Project’s deadline estimation strategies 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The Russian-speaking community in most cases has a better deadline estimation for a project. This phenomenon can be associated with the fact that the Russian R&D team members initially declare longer deadlines for the project as they follow the “worst-case scenario” principle. The worst-case deadline makes it possible for the customer to prepare for all the necessary requirements to obtain the desired results on time even if unexpected circumstances suddenly happened. Israeli colleagues strive to complete their work as soon as possible as they follow the “best-case scenario” principle (also known in the Israeli culture as “everything will be fine”). Sometimes it can cause transfer deadlines and changes in the project plan.

			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The “doing my thing” vs. “I know what we all should do”
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The native Israeli community likes to be involved in subjects out of their direct responsibility. Russian-speaking specialists rarely seek to participate in the discussion of the specifics and direction of the company and prefer not to give advice to employees from another department. This is due to the fact that they are aimed primarily to fulfill their main duties. Israeli specialists are more enthusiastic about discussing company development issues. They believe that the opinion of each employee is very important for improving the work of the whole company.

			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				Deep vs. wide professional knowledge  
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The Russian-speaking community likes broad knowledge while the native Israeli prefer more focused knowledge. This can be easily explained if one familiar with the education in the post-Soviet countries gives knowledge from various disciplines for harmonious and comprehensive human development. The commitment to this system of training is expressed in the desire to expand the background of an individual, to study related fields. Where the main aim is to find new ways to solve problems and perform their job better. On the other hand, Israeli professionals are known for their extensive knowledge in a narrow specialty, which allows them not to doubt their competence.
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				Nine to five vs. free spirits 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The majority of Russian-speaking workers keep the established work schedule. They are more punctual in meetings and rarely respect the irregular work schedule. Israeli employees are more flexible in working hours and often agree to hold business meetings in the evening while missing office hours in the early morning.

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				It is extremely important to remember that  these observations do not currently characterize   each and every specialist from either group. Each of us is unique in its own way. Nevertheless, these characteristics should well-represent the average person in both these communities.. If you recognize yourself in this article or strongly disagree with our observations, we thank you for taking this ride with us to the future of the world’s technology!
