			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Moreover, many students and educators have already tested lectures through video conference. As a result, many people are interested in the field of education and the question it raises from it; specifically, the future of the field. For example, what are the prospects for online learning? What are the pros and cons of online learning for students?
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Experts from various fields of science and technology are involved in the active development and improvement of online education. Nevertheless, some general trends are formed today. The following is not a complete list, but just the most important points which affect every student. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			Pros
			</h3>
			
			<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 30px;">

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b>Mobility: </b>A student with a computer and the Internet can study anywhere. This makes it possible not to waste time on travel. It is also more convenient for students to combine work and study. In addition, students from the geographical periphery gets equal opportunity. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b>Self-organization: </b>Students more effectively interact with each other in project activities on the Internet [1]. This factor contributes to the development of online communication and time management skills.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b>Attention to different points of view: </b>In online learning, you can achieve a new, more constructive level of interaction between students and educators with a local forum or other online platform. In such an environment, students can express their opinions and it will be noticed. Thus, it is possible to more accurately take into account different views on the object of study and get an active generation of new ideas [1].
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b>Learning New Technologies: </b>Teachers, like students, learn about new technologies at the same time. This fact makes it possible to learn something new to everyone, regardless of faculty. In most cases, knowledge of new technologies allows you to do any research more efficiently and accurately. In addition, the study of new technologies makes the learning process easier and better.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b>Concentration of attention: </b>With online learning, students are less distracted by things not related to their studies. Interaction of people on the Internet often occurs only on the topic of study, therefore, attention remains much longer at the object of study and does not switch to interpersonal relationships.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			This point is especially important for people who prefer to study individually without a group. Thus, students can avoid unnecessary stress and anxiety [2].
			</p>

			<h3>
			Cons
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b> Lack og technical equipment for online learning: </b> Technical equipment such as computers or other devices and fast Internet may not be available to every student. The quality of technical equipment is very important for the learning process. If the student does not have a powerful computer or fast Internet, then the quality of education is worse. Unfortunately, this common problem is sometimes difficult to solve quickly.  
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b> Slow communication: </b> In the classroom, communication with a teacher and a group at the university is much faster than online. The discussion duration may be reduced due to technical and personal circumstances of each and every one of the participants.  
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b> Distractions: </b> Online learning requires high self-discipline and motivation. Learning in a place where you are often distracted (home, work, etc.) can significantly reduce your concentration. Ultimately, the student may fail the deadlines or not even learn the course material. Often this is because the student does not pay attention to these distractions during planning of educational process [3].   
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b> Asynchrony: </b>In most cases, studying on the Internet requires more time and effort than regular classroom study. This is due to the asynchronous participation of the educator and other students in the project. Perhaps, the the participants need time to answer your question on the Internet. At a regular meeting, such issues can be discussed faster [4].
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			<b> Practical study: </b>Some disciplines are not adapted for online learning. The pedagogy and psychology of online learning are very new topics in modern reality. Thus, lack of knowledge for some areas can adversely affect the quality of your practical skills.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Anyway, online learning is becoming an integral part of education. This is a new page in the history of education that we are writing right now. Thus, we are able to make this type of learning comfortable and effective for each of us. Understanding of motivation and creating the necessary conditions for online learning, we can change our life and the whole world for the better!
