				In our modern lives, we are aware of the growing importance of the medical field seeded in different illnesses, life-quality reducing physical and clinical issues, and others...  Recently, even faster-growing interest in medicine is associated with the spread of many diseases (diabetes, cancer, corona) and there influence on us as a society. In parallel, the development of new technologies and increasing understanding originated in scientific breakthroughs allowing us to better handle the situation. Many historical epidemics and even small-scale catastrophes clearly show us how frail the human body is and how dangerous diseases are. This situation is the bread and butter of the world’s communities of scientists and doctors. They discover new treatment protocols, the underline biological and chemical processes in the human body, and even the dynamics of things that may harm us. These discoveries were not possible previously but they do now thanks to the hyper-jump the technology goes in the last few decades. Thanks to these professionals and their work, the lifespan, and quality of our life are in continuous improvement.

			In the last two decades, the study and use of nanoparticles in medicine is gaining popularity. In the last five years, a more sophisticated approach, medical nanorobotics, is finding its way to be one of the biggest promises of the medicine of tomorrow. While the subject of medical nanorobotics entering to the main-stream media and professional newsbreaks, these do not necessarily reflect accurate scientific results, and ordinary readers may misinterpret the results the author of such popular-science papers tried to present. As a result, we found ourselves in a situation where a real scientific discovery may take the form of unsupported fears and doubts originated in poorly communicated information.
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			In this paper, we will clarify and innovate a few things about medical nanorobotics by talking with a specialist who is directly working on the subject. A Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Bar Ilan University (Israel) Teddy Lazebnik. In the last 3 years, Teddy is leading research on how to model medical nanorobots, allowing doctors in the future to replace traditional capsuled drugs with capsules of medical nanorobots (MNR) personalized to the patient. He will answer all our questions about MNRs. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>
			What medical nanorobots are?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			Well, there is no consensus in the research community about what medical nanorobotics are. In a manner of fact, the definition of medical nanoparticles (MNP) is still loose. The best one so far, that most of the researchers fully or partially agreed on is “a matter that used to analyze or cure diseases and range between 1 and 100 nm in diameter”.  This definition is a bit wide and yet, fails to include all the MNP in the literature but includes treatments that definitely not related to MNP. The case for MNR is even more complicated with less broad agreement. Personally, I define MNR as MNP with at least 2 states that can alternate according to changes in the MNR’s environment. For example, consider a MNP with some drug inside it. If the MNP can be opened when for example it is next to cancer tumor and release the drug it carries than we consider it a MNR.

			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
			How do MNRs enter the body? 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				Currently, MNRs are been injected into the blood system directed, similar to other drugs. 
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				Who controls the MNRs?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				This is a complex question in the manner that there are many very different types of MNRs. It will be fair to divide the answer into 2 groups of MNRs. The first one is the automotive MNRs which have not been controlled after the first injection.  This type of MNRs is independent from the moment it has been injected and can be only monitored in the process while actively change the MNRs behavior during the process is inaccessible. The other group is guided-MNRs which partially guided by a device outside the body. For example, consider a MNR made of magnetic metal. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) it is possible to track in real-time the location of the MNRs in the body and by applying the right magnetic field to pull the MNRs to some desired location. 
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				How do MNRs understand which part of the body they need to get into? 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				First, this is a common mistake that needs to be tackled. MNR does not “understand” or “calculate”. Currently, MNRs are too small to include either a processing unit, memory unit or mechanical output device needed for modern computing (so commonly associated with the word “robot”). Now, MNRs flow in the bloodstream as other materials and as so getting to different parts of the body. The interesting question is how they open \ stay in the right part of the body to either cure or allow later analysis of some illness. There is no single answer to this question as any MNR is specifically designed for such a task which involves a deep biological, chemical and physical understanding of the body and the illnesses that needed to be treated.

			</div>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				How are MNRs exit from the body?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The amazing answer - naturally. The human body knows how to recognize these MNRs and clear them. This process is composed of several biological systems in the body and is still an active field of study. 
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				What is the difference between MNR which used for treatment and these used for diagnosis?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				The diversity in the types of MNRs in both these groups is making the answer to this question a bit tricky. I can say with confidence that the main difference is that diagnosis MNRs is designed to have minimal effect on the body which allows getting a clear image of the patient’s condition with as little interruptions as possible. On the other hand, treatment MNRs are designed to change the patient’s condition (hopefully for the better).
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				What diseases can be treated with nanorobots?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				I think this is still early to answer this question. Promising treatment protocols have already been investigated for many diseases, showing initial good results. That been said, additional research and careful examination need to be done before releasing such solutions to the public’s hands. Personally, I am interested in cancer and diabetes treatment using MNRs which has been broadly investigated, already achieving positive results in mice.
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				What are the risks associated with using MNRs?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				Similarly to other drug-based treatments, an overdose is a big issue.  It is fair to mention that overdose is not connected specifically with MNRs but with the drug they carry. Except for this, MNRs are actually safer alternative than other treatments.  
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				What is the future of medical nanorobotics technology? 
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				My humble opinion is that MNR’s technology will involve from traditional engineering where a team is executing the whole process (from MNR design, through prodcutin and up to medical treatment implication) to a modern one where each task in the chain is separated and the professionals handling it needs to master only the task in hand and not the whole pipeline. Such a revolution should speed up the development of new MNRs and their usage in clinical treatments. In parallel, smarter and faster MNR production should be invented to make sure this solution leaves the laboratories and become accessible to most of the population.  
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				What does your research in the field of medical nanorobotics is focused on?
			</h3>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				My research is focusing on modeling MNRs from a mathematical and computational point of view, allowing professionals to harness the modern abilities of computers in the process of developing new clinical treatment protocols based on already available MNRs. In such, providing a platform for professionals to master only a specific task in the pipeline and allowing the computer to connect the dots for us. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
				In summary, medical nanorobotics is one of the leading promises in medical for the last few years and
				hopefully we shall start see MNR based treatments in a decade or two. Until then, let us all remember
				that this is not a sprint but a marathon when it comes to developing new clinical treatments in particular

				and doing a research in general. Currently, there are more questions than answers but isn&#39;t it an
				excitement time to live at? Observing when history is done and we getting to harness particles that we
				cannot see in a system that we yet fully understand but still accomplishing baby step each passing day.
				Feel free to follow up on Teddy&#39;s work at his website (teddylazebnik.info/) where he shares updates and
				academic publications on the subject.
