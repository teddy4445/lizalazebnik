			No one can deny that the coronavirus leaves a mark in our lives for a long time. All of us so differently faced various difficulties. Someone may be ill and we wish him/her a speedy recovery! Someone faced problems in the financial sector, lost his job or was forced to close his business. At the same time, in the stream of information bulletins, daily statistics and various news about quarantine conditions, we are missing something important that could radically change our lives too. This is exactly what we cannot ignore or instruct the state to decide for us. Yes, you guessed it right, this is a relationship with your partner. For most people, the sudden and prolonged confinement in the four walls was a shock, from which it would be difficult to recover, as well as from the new economic crisis. None of us even in our wildest fantasies imagined what it would be like to be together 24/7 for more than a month in one house or separately without dates. Psychologists sound the alarm, because prolonged isolation in a limited space not only seriously changes each person, but also leads to conflicts between partners, and in some cases can develop into domestic violence.
            </p>
			
			<p>
			Most of the couples, who sincerely believed that they were completely happy in their relationship, after a few weeks of isolation, find that not everything is so smooth. The inability to ignore a negative situation every day pushes people to attempt to quickly resolve problems sometimes even using radical and improper methods for partners. If someone steps over this line, then not only a young couple but also a family with many years of experience living together may be destroyed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			So, what can we do to save the most valuable and important in our lives? This question is being asked more and more every day. Many psychologists and specialists in relationships and family seek to offer a variety of ways to overcome difficulties. Considering the opinion and experience of different couples who have faced similar problems and have overcome them, there are several small tricks that you can experience in practice right now:
			</p>
			
			<p>
			1) Keep calm! Like you, it is extremely difficult for your partner to survive the stress caused by fear for the health and financial well-being. You need to find the strength in yourself and remember what can bring you into a state of peace, even for a short time. It can be meditation, a bathtub with sea salt and oils, relaxing music, watching several episodes of a funny series or playing a musical instrument. This is the first and very important step in the fight against panic. So, you can see the situation as it is in itself, without the pressure of external circumstances. In a quarantine situation, we use the principle of oxygen masks in an airplane applies, when you first provide yourself with a mask, and then a child or a person who needs it. Only if you calmly and see the situation, you can protect yourself and help your partner. In conditions of calm, you can talk sincerely; share your feelings and concerns. You can learn about the causes of certain actions and understand the true motives for action. With this approach, in most cases, it often turns out that the problem looks completely different, and your frustration was caused by a distorted perception of reality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			2) One goal - one idea! You need to make a general daily ritual that will please you. This can be any activity that will give positive emotions or distract from thoughts about the coronavirus and problems. Every day spent in self-isolation, you can write to each other a short letter where you tell about one quality of your soul mate, for which you are very grateful. You can do morning or evening pair exercises, learn pair dance with the help of video lessons, sing your favorite songs or start another new hobby that you have long dreamed about, but didn't find the time. It is also important that both partners participate in the selection of a new hobby. By the way, this is also suitable for couples who are separated and cannot meet due to Covid-19. These "lucky" can count down the days until the long-awaited date, read favorite poems of each other or watch a movie and then discuss it. It is important that once a day you find time specifically for each other, and not for children, parents, work and other worries.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			3) A great journey begins with a small step! We all understand that coronavirus will be over and we will all return to normal life. Now is the right time to dream, discuss your ideas with your soulmate and make new plans! As a small team, you will not feel lonely and helpless in the face of a world in which you will have to solve several problems after coronavirus. You will see a goal that you will strive for together. You can choose a new destination for your next trip, discuss the new design of your kitchen, plan a family celebration in a beautiful place, or just dream about what you will do when Covid-19 is over.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Each couple is unique and not all recommendations are universal, but there is something that works at all times and in any country. This is Love. We want to believe that thanks to love we will stay together and become more wise, strong and happy.
